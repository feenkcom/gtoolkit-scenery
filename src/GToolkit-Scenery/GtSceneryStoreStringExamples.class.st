"
I am a class for storing Sceneries with a storeStringMethod defined.

Any Scenery can have a storeStringMethod, which identifies a gtExemple method of an arbitrary class.
If defined, the scenery will offer a “save” action to override that method with the current storeString as a `<noTest>` gtExample method that can be replayed.

NB: For larger sceneries, we should probably use JSON instead to expert sceneries as files.
